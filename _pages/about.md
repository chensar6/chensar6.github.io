Hi! My name is Sarah. I've recently graduated from the University of Toronto in Industrial Engineering with certificates in AI Engineering and Engineering Business. I have a strong interest in healthcare and data analytics. 

In my free time, I like to stay active by running, weightlifting, and playing sports. I have nerdier hobbies as well, like playing Dungeons & Dragons (5e 2014), boardgames (Wingspan, Catan, etc.), and video games (I've played a whole bunch... hard to list out). A goal of mine is to travel across China and eventually gain absolute fluency over my mother tongue, so far I've been to: Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi'an, Zhangjiajie, and Shanghai.

While I was born in 2002, having a sister that is 10 years older than me exposed me to a lot of the different corners of the early internet. At the age of 4, I remember playing Old School Runescape and Maplestory. I caught onto the gameplay quick but I remember never being able to spell out proper sentences, hahaha. One of the biggest things I miss about the earlier days of the internet was the informal blogging culture, e.g., Angelfire blogs. My aim for this website is for it to be an informal blog of the personal and professional matters of my life, so that people can get a gauge of the type of person I am easily!
